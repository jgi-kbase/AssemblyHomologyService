# If "true", make the server ignore the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers. Otherwise
# (the default behavior), the logged IP address for a request, in order of precedence, is
# 1) the first address in X-Forwarded-For, 2) X-Real-IP, and 3) the address of the client.

# Filter settings
#
# The remainder of the settings configure filters for the sequence data
# returned from the Minhash implementation. If namespaces requiring filters are loaded into the
# storage system those filters must be configured here. Any number of filters may be specified
# and the filtering system is extensible. Namespaces that do not specify a filter undergo no
# filtering. A KBase filter that filters out data to which the user does not have access
# is supplied.

# The list of enabled filters:
filters=
#filters=kbase

# The configuration variables for each filter are:
# filter-<name>-factory-class=<class>
# filter-<name>-init-<key>=<value>
#
# Where:
# <name> is the name of the filter as given in the filters list above. This name has no meaning
#     outside of this file - it simply groups the filter parameters together.
# <class> is the factory class for the filter
# <key> and <value> are key value pairs that are passed to the filter at initialization. Any
#     number of pairs are allowed.
