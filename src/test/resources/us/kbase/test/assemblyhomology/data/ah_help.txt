Usage: assembly_homology [options] [command] [command options]
  Options:
    -c, --config
      Path to the assembly homology configuration file.
      Default: ./deploy.cfg
    -h, --help
      Display help and usage information.
    -v, --verbose
      Print full stack trace on error.
      Default: false
  Commands:
    load      Load data into the database
      Usage: load [options]
        Options:
          -i, --implementation
            The MinHash implementation to use.
            Default: mash
          -l, --load-id
            The id for the load. If one is not supplied, a random ID will be 
            generated. Reusing a load ID will cause sequence data for matching 
            IDs to be overwritten. Any data associated with IDs exclusive to 
            the previous load will remain.
        * -n, --namespace-yaml
            The path to the YAML file containing information about the 
            namespace to be created or updated. See the documentation for the 
            syntax. 
        * -s, --sequence-metadata
            the path to the file containing information about each sequence in 
            the sketch DB. See the documentation for the syntax.
        * -k, --sketch-db
            The path to the sketch database. This path will be recorded in the 
            assembly homology service database as the path to the sketch 
            database, so ensure the sketch database is in its permanent 
            location.
